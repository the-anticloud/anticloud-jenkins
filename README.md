# About

In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server.
Built with Java, it provides over 2,000 [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to support automating virtually anything,
so that humans can spend their time doing things machines cannot.

# What to Use Jenkins for and When to Use It

Use Jenkins to automate your development workflow, so you can focus on work that matters most. Jenkins is commonly used for:

- Building projects
- Running tests to detect bugs and other issues as soon as they are introduced
- Static code analysis
- Deployment

Execute repetitive tasks, save time, and optimize your development process with Jenkins.

# Downloads

The Jenkins project provides official distributions as WAR files, Docker images, native packages and installers for platforms including several Linux distributions and Windows.
See the [Downloads](https://www.jenkins.io/download) page for references.

For all distributions Jenkins offers two release lines:

- [Weekly](https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/) -
  Frequent releases which include all new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
- [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/) -
  Older release line which gets periodically updated via bug fix backports.

*Excerpt from upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md`:*

# Contributing to Jenkins

This page provides information about contributing code to the Jenkins core codebase.

:exclamation: There's a lot more to the Jenkins project than just code. For more information on the ways that you can contribute to the Jenkins project, see [Participate](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/).

## Getting started

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. source the forked project to your machine
3. Install the necessary development tools. In order to develop Jenkins, you need the following:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or 25.
     In the Jenkins project we usually use [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/), but you can use other JDKs as well.
   - Apache Maven 3.9.6 or above. You can [download Maven here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
     In the Jenkins project we usually use the most recent Maven release.
   - Any IDE which supports importing Maven projects.
4. Set up your development environment as described in [Preparing for Plugin Development](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/prepare/)

If you want to contribute to Jenkins, or just learn about the project,
you can start by fixing some easier issues.
In the Jenkins issue tracker we mark such issues as `good first issue`.
You can find them by using this query (check the link) for [good first issues](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).

## Building and Debugging

The Jenkins core build flow is built around Maven.
You can read a description of the [building and debugging process here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/building/).

### Building the WAR file

If you want simply to build the `jenkins.war` file as fast as possible without tests, run:

```sh
mvn -am -pl war,bom -Pquick-build clean install
```

The WAR file will be created in `war/target/jenkins.war`.

> [!NOTE]
> `quick-build` sets `maven.test.skip`, so test classes are not compiled and are not present
> afterwards. To build something you can then run tests against, drop the profile or pass
> `-Dmaven.test.skip=false`.

`clean` deliberately leaves `node/`, `node_modules/` and `.yarn/` in place, so the node
toolchain and the downloaded packages survive between builds. Pass `-Dclean.node` to delete
those as well.

If you are only changing backend code and `war/src/main/webapp/jsbundles` is already populated
from an earlier build, `-Dskip.frontend=true` skips the node installation, `y

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`37a5946dfb65d73c507fd1406f568bd45ed01cb5eeeb3576a9c8cab0106da5d8`.

| Framework | Controls | Evidence | Coverage | Result |

| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| OWASP Top 10 (2021) | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| SOC 2 Type II readiness | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST AI Risk Management Framework | 8 controls mapped | 8 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | 12 controls mapped | 12 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |

| ML Technology Readiness Level | TRL 8 | 8/8 criteria | | PASS |

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
